     * from a clock that increments monotonically and linearly in time 
     * to allow synchronization and jitter calculations. 
     * The resolution of the clock must be sufficient for the 
     * desired synchronization accuracy and for measuring packet 
     * arrival jitter (one tick per video frame is typically not 
     * sufficient).  The clock frequency is dependent on the format of 
     * data carried as payload and is specified statically in the 
     * profile or payload format specification that defines the format, 
     * or may be specified dynamically for payload formats defined 
     * through non-RTP means. If RTP packets are generated 
     * periodically, the nominal sampling instant as determined from 
     * the sampling clock is to be used, not a reading of the system 
     * clock. As an example, for fixed-rate audio the timestamp clock 
     * would likely increment by one for each sampling period.  If an 
     * audio application reads blocks covering 160 sampling periods 
     * from the input device, the timestamp would be increased by 160 
     * for each such block, regardless of whether the block is 
     * transmitted in a packet or dropped as silent. 
     * 
     * The initial value of the timestamp is random, as for the sequence 
     * number. Several consecutive RTP packets may have equal timestamps if 
     * they are (logically) generated at once, e.g., belong to the same 
     * video frame. Consecutive RTP packets may contain timestamps that are 
     * not monotonic if the data is not transmitted in the order it was 
     * sampled, as in the case of MPEG interpolated video frames. (The
