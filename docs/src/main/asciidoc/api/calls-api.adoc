== Working on a production server
Using filter is a good practice on a server with thousands or millions of calls

....
curl -X GET  http://administrator%40company.com:77f8c12cc7b8f8423e5c38b035249166@127.0.0.1:8080/restcomm/2012-04-24/Calls
....

If the system hasn't received any calls, you will see the the output below

[source,lang:xml,decode:true]
----
<RestcommResponse>
  <Calls page="0" numpages="0" pagesize="50" total="0" start="0" end="0" uri="/restcomm/2012-04-24/Calls" firstpageuri="/restcomm/2012-04-24/Calls?Page=0&amp;PageSize=50" previouspageuri="null" nextpageuri="null" lastpageuri=="/restcomm/2012-04-24/Calls?Page=0&amp;PageSize=50"/>

== List Filter

**HTTP GET**. The following GET query string parameters allow you to limit the list returned. Note, parameters are case-sensitive:

=== Request Parameters

[cols=",",options="header",]
|===========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================
|Parameter |Description
|To |Only show calls to this phone number or Client identifier.
|From |Only show calls from this phone number or Client identifier.
|Status |Only show calls currently in this status. May be queued, ringing, in-progress, canceled, completed, failed, busy, or no-answer.
|StartTime |Only show calls that started on this date, given as YYYY-MM-DD. Also supports inequalities, such as StartTime=YYYY-MM-DD for calls that started at or before midnight on a date, and StartTime=YYYY-MM-DD for calls that started at or after midnight on a date.
|ParentCallSid |Only show calls spawned by the call with this Sid.
|===========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

 

=== Filter using the From parameter.

he example below will only return Calls made from client Alice

....
 curl -X GET  http://administrator%40company.com:77f8c12cc7166@127.0.0.1:8080/restcomm-sbc/2012-04-24/Calls?From=alice
....

The result will be similar to the one below
