== Restcomm-SBC building

* You will need to create a script to build Restcomm-SBC.
Copy the script below into a bash script on your local directory at the root of the RestComm-SBC.
In this tutorial, the script below is stored in the file *restcomm-sbc-build.sh*.

[source,bash]
----
#!/bin/bash
export RESTCOMM_HOME=/home/yuliachornobrivets/Restcomm-SBC
export MAJOR_VERSION_NUMBER=7.6
export BUILD_NUMBER=0

export WORKSPACE=$RESTCOMM_HOME
mkdir $WORKSPACE/dependencies
export DEPENDENCIES_HOME=$WORKSPACE/dependencies


ant release -f ./release/build.xml -Drestcomm.release.version=$MAJOR_VERSION_NUMBER.$BUILD_NUMBER -Drestcomm.branch.name=restcomm-release-$MAJOR_VERSION_NUMBER.$BUILD_NUMBER -Dcheckout.restcomm.dir=$RESTCOMM_HOME -Dworkspace.restcomm.dir=$RESTCOMM_HOME/restcomm -Dcheckout.dir=$DEPENDENCIES_HOME
----

* Change the restcomm-sbc-build.sh permission to make it executable as follows

[source,bash]
----
chmod +x ./restcomm-sbc-build.sh
----
The RestComm directory should now display the following content:

* Now, run the build script as follows:
[source,bash]
----
./restcomm-sbc-build.sh
----

This may take a while to build. If the build is successful, you should see this output at the end of the build:

[source,bash]
----
make-final-zip:

    [zip] Building zip: /home/username/Restcomm-SBC/release/SBC-JBoss-AS7-1.0.0.zip
