== Restcomm-SBC building

* You will need to create a script to build Restcomm-SBC.
Copy the script below into a bash script on your local directory at the root of the RestComm-SBC.
In this tutorial, the script below is stored in the file *restcomm-sbc-build.sh*.

[source,bash]
----
#!/bin/bash
export SBC_HOME=/root/sbc
export MAJOR_VERSION_NUMBER=1.0
export BUILD_NUMBER=356

export WORKSPACE=$SBC_HOME
mkdir $WORKSPACE/dependencies
export DEPENDENCIES_HOME=$WORKSPACE/dependencies


ant release -f ./release/build.xml -Dsbc.release.version=$MAJOR_VERSION_NUMBER.$BUILD_NUMBER -Dsbc.branch.name=sbc-release-$MAJOR_VERSION_NUMBER.$BUILD_NUMBER -Dcheckout.sbc.dir=$SBC_HOME -Dworkspace.sbc.dir=$SBC_HOME -Dcheckout.dir=$DEPENDENCIES_HOME

----

* Change the restcomm-sbc-build.sh permission to make it executable as follows

[source,bash]
----
chmod +x ./restcomm-sbc-build.sh
----

* Now, run the build script as follows:
[source,bash]
----
./restcomm-sbc-build.sh
----

This may take a while to build. If the build is successful, you should see this output at the end of the build:

[source,bash]
----

make-final-zip:
      [zip] Building zip: /root/sbc/SBC-Tomcat7-1.0.356.zip
