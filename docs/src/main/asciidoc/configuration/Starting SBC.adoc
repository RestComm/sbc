= Starting Restcomm-SBC

== Requirements

* Install link:http://linuxaria.com/howto/linux-subnet-calculator-cidr[IPCalc]
* Install link:http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/installing.html[MySQL]
* You must have link:http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html[JDK - 7] installed on your computer

== Download and unzip Restcomm SBC binary

_If you you have already installed Restcomm SBC you can <<Configure Restcomm IP information>> at once_

* Go to a local directory on your computer and run the following command ( <xxx> is the release version number):

[source,bash]
----
wget https://mobicents.ci.cloudbees.com/job/RestComm-SBC/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/SBC-Tomcat7-<xxx>.zip
----

* Unzip the binary to a local directory. It should be similar to this one:
*SBC-Tomcat7-1.0.869.zip*.
  Further we shall refer to this above SBC directory as the *$SBC_HOME*.
  
=== Configuring your SIP domain

edit the main RestComm-SBC configuration file located in  $SBC_HOME/webapps/restcomm-sbc/WEB-INF/conf/sbc.xml

and you will find the domain parameter:

[source,bash]
----
 <domain>cloud.eolos.la</domain>
----
Change it to your SIP target chosen domain.

After that configure the IP/Host target of your SIP termination service on the MZ

[source,bash]
----
<militarized-zone-target>
    <ip-address>192.168.120.2</ip-address>
    <failover-ip-address>192.168.120.96</failover-ip-address>
</militarized-zone-target>

----



[source,bash]
----
  
cd $SBC-HOME/bin

and launch the SBC container by typing:

./catalina.sh start

after that, look at the logs to confirm everything started gracefully.

tail -f $SBC_HOME/logs/catalina.out


----


[ip-information]
== Configure Restcomm SBC IP information
=== Add your IP address
When RestComm-SBC has started without errors, you will be able to configure its Network interfaces.

RestComm-SBC needs, at least, two phisical network interfaces. At least one for De-militarized-zone and at least one for Militarized-zone.

The first step is to tag each network interface in order to declare
what side of the SBC it will serve. You can check your available network interfaces thru the RestComm-SBC autodiscovering feature:

[source,bash]
----
curl -X GET  http://ACae6e420f425248d6a26948c17a9e2acf:77f8c12cc7b8f8423e5c38b035249166@127.0.0.1:8080/restcomm-sbc/2012-04-24/NetworkPoints
----

After executing this command you will get the following output:

[source,bash]
----
<RestcommResponse>
  <NetworkPoints>
    <NetworkPoint>
      <Id>eth1-0</Id>
      <MacAddress>94DE80228FC2</MacAddress>
      <Description>eth1</Description>
      <Tag>MZ</Tag>
      <AccountSid>ACae6e420f425248d6a26948c17a9e2acf</AccountSid>
    </NetworkPoint>
    <NetworkPoint>
      <Id>eth0-0</Id>
      <MacAddress>C4E98402F438</MacAddress>
      <Description>eth0</Description>
      <Tag>DMZ</Tag>
      <AccountSid>ACae6e420f425248d6a26948c17a9e2acf</AccountSid>
    </NetworkPoint>
  </NetworkPoints>
</RestcommResponse>
----

NOTE: The obtained list is the enumeration of all usable network interfaces installed on your system. In the case of the example, the system is equiped with 2 NICs: eth0-0 already tagged to give service to DMZ and eth1-0 already tagged to give service to MZ. In your setup you will find NICs not already tagged as IDLE.


* Select which NIC will serve each SBC zone. As a rule of thumb, MZ is your LAN, where your SIP Service resides and Internet is your DMZ, from where untrusted endpoints will get service.

* Tag your NICs, in the example:


----
curl -X POST http://ACae6e420f425248d6a26948c17a9e2acf:77f8c12cc7b8f8423e5c38b035249166@127.0.0.1:8080/restcomm-sbc/2012-04-24/NetworkPoints/ -d "Id=eth0-0" -d "Tag=DMZ"

curl -X POST http://ACae6e420f425248d6a26948c17a9e2acf:77f8c12cc7b8f8423e5c38b035249166@127.0.0.1:8080/restcomm-sbc/2012-04-24/NetworkPoints/ -d "Id=eth1-0" -d "Tag=MZ"
----

* Once each network interface is tagged we must proceed to attach desired service connectors to them. In the example we add a SIP connector for UDP service on port 5060 and a WEBRTC SIP connector on port 5083 to eth0-0: 

[source,bash]
----
curl -X POST http://ACae6e420f425248d6a26948c17a9e2acf:77f8c12cc7b8f8423e5c38b035249166@127.0.0.1:8080/restcomm-sbc/2012-04-24/Connectors/ -d "NetworkPointId=eth0-0" -d "Transport=UDP" -d "Port=5060"

curl -X POST http://ACae6e420f425248d6a26948c17a9e2acf:77f8c12cc7b8f8423e5c38b035249166@127.0.0.1:8080/restcomm-sbc/2012-04-24/Connectors/ -d "NetworkPointId=eth0-0" -d "Transport=WSS" -d "Port=5083"
----

* Now, we add a SIP connector for UDP service on port 5060  to eth1-0 pointing to the LAN: 

[source,bash]
----
curl -X POST http://ACae6e420f425248d6a26948c17a9e2acf:77f8c12cc7b8f8423e5c38b035249166@127.0.0.1:8080/restcomm-sbc/2012-04-24/Connectors/ -d "NetworkPointId=eth1-0" -d "Transport=UDP" -d "Port=5060"
----

If we list the just created Connectors we will find its sids and the autodiscover IPs:

[source,bash]
----
<RestcommResponse>
  <Connectors>
    <Connector>
      <IpAddress>201.216.233.185</IpAddress>
      <Sid>CNae6e420f425248d6a26948c17a9e2aaa</Sid>
      <Port>5060</Port>
      <NetworkPointId>eth0-0</NetworkPointId>
      <Transport>UDP</Transport>
      <State>UP</State>
      <AccountSid>ACae6e420f425248d6a26948c17a9e2acf</AccountSid>
    </Connector>
    <Connector>
      <IpAddress>192.168.120.6</IpAddress>
      <Sid>CNae6e420f425248d6a26948c17a9e2bbb</Sid>
      <Port>5060</Port>
      <NetworkPointId>eth1-0</NetworkPointId>
      <Transport>UDP</Transport>
      <State>UP</State>
      <AccountSid>ACae6e420f425248d6a26948c17a9e2acf</AccountSid>
    </Connector>
    <Connector>
      <IpAddress>201.216.233.185</IpAddress>
      <Sid>CNae6e420f425248d6a26948c17a9e2ccc</Sid>
      <Port>5083</Port>
      <NetworkPointId>eth0-0</NetworkPointId>
      <Transport>WSS</Transport>
      <State>UP</State>
      <AccountSid>ACae6e420f425248d6a26948c17a9e2acf</AccountSid>
    </Connector>
  </Connectors>
</RestcommResponse>
----

* Now, we add a couple of routes to define the traffic policy from DMZ to MZ: 

[source,bash]
----
curl -X POST http://ACae6e420f425248d6a26948c17a9e2acf:77f8c12cc7b8f8423e5c38b035249166@127.0.0.1:8080/restcomm-sbc/2012-04-24/Routes/ -d "SourceConnectorSid=CNae6e420f425248d6a26948c17a9e2aaa" -d "TargetConnectorSid=CNae6e420f425248d6a26948c17a9e2bbb"

curl -X POST http://ACae6e420f425248d6a26948c17a9e2acf:77f8c12cc7b8f8423e5c38b035249166@127.0.0.1:8080/restcomm-sbc/2012-04-24/Routes/ -d "SourceConnectorSid=CNae6e420f425248d6a26948c17a9e2ccc" -d "TargetConnectorSid=CNae6e420f425248d6a26948c17a9e2bbb"

==== Tips on ways to obtain the network interface data
* First you have to get the information on your network interface. Run the command:

[source,bash]
----
 netstat -nr
----
* Picture below shows sample output for the command.
Your *network interface* you can find in the Iface column in the same row where Gateway is indicated (for example wlx60e32716068a).

* You will have multiple rows for the same network interface.
One of the rows in the Destination column contains the *network address* (for example 172.21.0.0).

==== Tips on ways to obtain the public IP
* In order to get your public ip address you should run the following command:

[source,bash]
----
ifconfig
----
* You will have to find the same network interface name.
The information you will need can be found in the output:

image::images/8.png[]

* Your *IP address* (for example 172.21.0.107) you will see in
[source,bash]
----
inet addr
----

* Your *subnet mask* (for example 255.255.255.0) you will see in
[source,bash]
----
Mask
----
* Your *broadcast address* (for example 172.21.0.255) you will see in
[source,bash]
----
Bcast
----


* Open your web browser and go to the url â€“ *http://IP:8080*.
Instead of "IP" you should put your IP.

* Log in with the *administrator@company.com* username and the *RestComm* password.
Then you should change the default password.

* If you need to stop the Restcomm-SBC you need to go to *$SBC_HOME/bin/*
directory and run
[source,bash]
----
./catalina.sh stop
----
== Making Test SIP Calls using the Demo Apps

* Open any SIP phone of your choice.

* Register to a DMZ service connector with valid credentials at your SIP backoffice.

* Make a test call at any valid number at your SIP backoffice.
