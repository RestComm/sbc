= Starting Restcomm-SBC

== Requirements

* Install link:http://linuxaria.com/howto/linux-subnet-calculator-cidr[IPCalc]
* Install link:http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/installing.html[MySQL]
* You must have link:http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html[JDK - 7] installed on your computer

== Download and unzip Restcomm SBC binary

_If you you have already installed Restcomm SBC you can <<Configure Restcomm IP information>> at once_

* Go to a local directory on your computer and run the following command ( <xxx> is the release version number):

[source,bash]
----
wget https://mobicents.ci.cloudbees.com/job/RestComm/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/SBC-Tomcat-<xxx>.zip
----

* Unzip the binary to a local directory. It should be similar to this one:
*SBC-Tomcat-1.0.869.zip*.
  Further we shall refer to this above SBC directory as the *$SBC_HOME*.

[ip-information]
== Configure Restcomm SBC IP information
=== Add your IP address
_A single host may have multiple IP addresses.
To get Restcomm working properly it is important to indicate the right IP address.
For local testing you can use localhost address (e.g. 127.0.0.1), in real working environment you will
need to use your public IP address._

* Go to the directory *$SBC_HOME/bin/restcomm*.
* Open the file *restcomm.conf*.
* Go to the section *# Network configuration*. You have to indicate the following information:

[source,bash]
----
# Network configuration
NET_INTERFACE=''
PRIVATE_IP=''
SUBNET_MASK=''
NETWORK=''
BROADCAST_ADDRESS=''
----
==== Obtaining the network interface
* First you have to get the information on your network interface. Run the command:

[source,bash]
----
 netstat -r
----
* Picture below shows sample output for the command.
Your *network interface* you can find in the Iface column in the same row where Gateway is indicated (for example wlx60e32716068a).

* You will have multiple rows for the same network interface.
One of the rows in the Destination column contains the *network address* (for example 172.21.0.0).

==== Obtaining the public IP
* In order to get your public ip address you should run the following command:

[source,bash]
----
ifconfig
----
* You will have to find the same network interface name.
The information you will need can be found in the output:

inet addr
----

* Your *subnet mask* (for example 255.255.255.0) you will see in
[source,bash]
----
Mask
----
* Your *broadcast address* (for example 172.21.0.255) you will see in
[source,bash]
----

==== Network configuration
* Insert the network configuration details of your server in the following variables:

[source,bash]
----
# Network configuration
NET_INTERFACE='wlx60e32716068a'
PRIVATE_IP='172.21.0.107'
SUBNET_MASK='255.255.255.0'
NETWORK='172.21.0.0'
BROADCAST_ADDRESS='172.21.0.255'
----



* Save and exit the restcomm.conf file.

screen -r restcomm
----

* To see the Restcomm Media Server startup process run the command:

screen -r mms
----

* Open your web browser and go to the url â€“ *http://IP:8080*.
Instead of "IP" you should put your IP.

Then you should change the default password.

* If you need to stop the Restcomm you need to go to *$RESTCOMM_HOME/bin/restcomm*
directory and run
[source,bash]
----
./stop-restcomm.sh
----
