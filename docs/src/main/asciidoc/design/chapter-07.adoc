== Media Proxy

One of the most important challenges of an SBC, is it ability to preserve sensible data hidden from a prospect attacker.
This feature is known as _Topology hiding_.
Topology hiding task is not only realted to the signalling path
 but to the entire data interchange between both sides of the SBC.
 
In order to meet this purpose, media flow has to be proxied, allowing
the SBC to always remain in the media path.
