The B2BUA acts as a Message router. It accepts incoming messages from its public interfaces, keep track of them and creates a new message session to the back and viceversa, decoupling public side from private side in two different session legs. This way, each message front just interchange messages between each side of the border, one UA to/from the backend and the other with the frontend. The B2BUA is responsible to keep track of session association between legs.
